# Bitcoin CO₂  - The Proof-of-Work / Waste Environmental Mining Disaster

Did you know? The Proof-of-work / waste mining in bitcoin  
is a global energy environmental disaster.  The estimate for bitcoin classic transactions is 300 kW/h per bitcoin transaction (!) 
that's about 179 kilograms of CO₂ emissions¹.

¹: Assuming let's say 0.596 kilograms of CO₂ per kW/h 
(that's the energy efficiency in Germany) that's 
about 179 kilograms of CO₂ per bitcoin transaction (300 kW/h × 0.596 kg). For more insights see the [Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption).
