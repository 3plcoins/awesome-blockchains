# Bitcoin CO₂  - The Proof-of-Work / Waste Environmental Mining Disaster

Did you know? The Proof-of-work / waste mining in bitcoin  
is a global energy environmental disaster.  The estimate for bitcoin classic transactions is 300 kW/h per bitcoin transaction (!) 
that's about 179 kilograms of CO₂ emissions¹.

¹: Assuming let's say 0.596 kilograms of CO₂ per kW/h 
(that's the energy efficiency in Germany) that's 
about 179 kilograms of CO₂ per bitcoin transaction (300 kW/h × 0.596 kg). For more insights see the [Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption).



Why? Why? Why?

Did you know? The only purpose for burning millions of $$$ in energy every day (or billions every year)
for the proof-of-work / waste hashing is... running a lottery that picks one (!) random winner every 10-minute, that's all.

> Bitcoin's hash rate experienced an explosive increase over 2019, jumping from 42 exahashes per second (EH/s) (or,
> 42,000,000,000,000,000,000 hashes per second) to 112 EH/s.
>
> Mining difficulty more than doubled from the beginning to the end of 2019, rising from 6 T to 13 T.

Note: No matter how many more tickets (e.g. from 42,000,000,000,000,000,000/s to 112,000,000,000,000,000,000/s) you "buy" by hashing more - the difficulty will rise (e.g. from 6 to 13)
and the lottery keeps on picking one (!) random winner every 10-minute.

Me: I just set a $100 bill on fire.  
Everyone: That's stupid.  
Me: I have undeniable proof.  
Bitcoiners: We'll give you $200 for it.  

From Saifedean Ammous' book _The Bitcoin Standard_:

> The question of whether Bitcoin wastes electricity is at its heart a misunderstanding of the fundamentally subjective nature of value.
> Electricity is generated worldwide in large quantities to satisfy the needs of consumers. 
> The only judgment about whether this electricity has gone to waste or not lies with the consumer who pays for it. 
> People who are willing to pay the cost of the operation of the Bitcoin network for their transactions are effectively 
> financing this electricity consumption, which means the electricity is being produced to satisfy [get-rich-quick] consumer needs
> and has not been wasted. 
> Functionally speaking, Proof-of-Work is the only method humans have invented for creating digital hard money. 
> If people find that worth paying for, the electricity has not been wasted.

That's the absurd logic from the Bitcoin is the new "Gold Standard" prophet.

[**How to Buy Bitcoin (The CO₂-Friendly Way)**](https://twitter.com/Tr0llyTr0llFace/status/1130390061499990016) by Trolly McTrollface

1. Take one $50 bill, five $10 bills, or ten $5 bills (I wouldn’t recommend change - stay with paper fiat).
2. Go to the bathroom.
3. Lift the lid of the loo.
4. Throw money in.
5. Flush down water.

Congrats! You just purchased $50 worth of Bitcoin - without fucking the planet!
