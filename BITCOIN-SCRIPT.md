# Bitcoin Script

_A mini blockchain contract programming language for locking (and unlocking) bitcoins (that is, unspent transaction outputs)_.

## Standard (Lock) Scripts / Contracts

- **P2PK** (Pay To Pubkey)
  - Example: `<pubKey> OP_CHECKSIG` - unlock with `<sig>`
- **P2PKH** (Pay To Pubkey Hash) 
  - Example: `OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <pubKeyHash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG` - unlock with `<sig> <pubKey>`

**More**

- **P2MS** (Pay To Multisig) - lets you to lock bitcoins to multiple public keys, and require signatures for some (or all) of those public keys to unlock it
  - Example 1 out of 2 keys required: `OP_1 <pubKey> <pubKey> OP_2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG` - unlock with `<sig>` 
- **P2SH** (Pay To Script Hash) - lets you create your own custom "redeem scripts", but still be able to share them easily with other people
  - Example: `OP_HASH160 <scriptHash> OP_EQUAL` - unlock with inputs required by the script (e.g. sig etc.) and the "redeem script" itself
- **NULL DATA** - lets you store data in bitcoin transactions
  - Example: `OP_RETURN <data>`
