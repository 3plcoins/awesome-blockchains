## Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.s) & Answers

**Q: Is the Git Repo a Blockchain?**

A: Yes, every branch in the git repo is a blockchain. 
The "classic" Satoshi-blockchain is like a git repo with a single master branch (only).

**Q: What's a Blockchain?**

A: A blockchain (originally block chain) is a distributed database with a linked list (that is, chain) of records (that is, blocks) secured by crypto(graphic) hashes.

**Q: What's a Merkle Tree?**

A: A Merkle tree is a hash tree named after Ralph Merkle who patented the concept in 1979. A hash tree is a generalization of hash lists or hash chains where every leaf node (in the tree) is labelled with a data block and every non-leaf node (in the tree) 
is labelled with the crypto(graphic) hash of the labels of its child nodes. For more see the [Merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) Wikipedia Article.

Note: By adding crypto(graphic) hash functions you can "merkelize" any data structure.

**Q: What's a Merkelized DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)?**

A: It's a blockchain secured by crypto(graphic) hashes that uses a directed acyclic graph data structure (instead of linear "classic" linked list). 

Note: Git uses merkelized dag (directed acyclic graph)s for its blockchains.
